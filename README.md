# Farmहित
SIH 2024 Hackathon Project

In a world where the earth’s bounty fed millions, six minds from different walks of life found themselves united by a singular vision. Each had witnessed the silent struggle of farmers—guardians of the land—whose hard work was often met with challenges that seemed insurmountable. As the world marched forward, these six saw the growing shadow of pollution, the overlooked wisdom of soil, and the untapped potential within crop residues.

Guided by a shared sense of responsibility and a deep empathy for those who nourish the world, they embarked on a journey. Through sleepless nights and relentless brainstorming, they conceived a solution—an online haven where farmers could find guidance, connect with labs to understand their soil, and turn what was once waste into wealth by selling crop residues to bio-pellet plants.

Their vision was not just to solve a problem, but to weave a future where farmers prosper, the land thrives, and the air remains pure—a harmonious balance for all.
